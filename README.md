# KK - LEGAL PORTAL

## Introduction ‚öñ‚ô•
Everyone is subjected to a fair court trial but not everyone in the Philippines has the capacity and privilege to avail the services of lawyers. According to the World Justice Project 2018 Survey, only 20% of Filipinos were able to access legal assistance, leaving 80% without. The reason for this, according to the UNDP poll, is because of the cost, inconvenience due to traffic/distance, lack of access to lawyers, and lack of time.   While the Republic Act no. 9999 or the Free Legal Assistance Act of 2010 states that the State shall guarantee free legal assistance to the poor, most people cannot access this law, more so under the effect of the current pandemic. This led to the researchers to study how viable Online Legal Services are in accessing legal services.
