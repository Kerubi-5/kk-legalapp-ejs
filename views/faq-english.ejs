                      As the client, you will decide the general direction of your matter. As your lawyer, our job is
                      to provide you with legal advice on the different options available to move your matter forward,
                      including the pros, cons and costs associated with each. We will usually make a recommendation,
                      but the final decision will be yours. We will then provide legal services necessary to carry out
                      your instructions.
                      <br><br>
                      We cannot accept instructions that are in conflict with our duties to the courts, other lawyers or
                      the public. The Code of Conduct of the Law Society of Alberta sets out the standards we as lawyers
                      are to meet.

                      Certain communications between solicitor and client are absolutely confidential. This is known
                      as “solicitor-client privilege.” Because of it, you can give your lawyer all of the facts relevant
                      to your matter without fear that prejudicial information will become public.

                      It is impossible to list all of the situations in which you should get legal advice, so we hve listed some common situations when you should get legal advice. This list is not complete, and if you have a question you think a lawyer might be able to help you with, contact the programs that serve your county and ask if they can help. You should not hesitate to ask for advice. You can find programs in your county by checking the Legal Services Links.
                      <br>
                      You should contact a lawyer if:
                      <br><br>
                      - You have been sued, or threatened with a lawsuit; <br>
                      - You have a dispute over legal documents such as a loan agreement, lease or other contract; <br>
                      - You need a divorce or help with custody of your children; <br>
                      - You have been abused by a family member; <br>
                      - You disagree with someone about how much you owe them or how much they owe you; <br>
                      - You think a government agency is not treating you fairly or you are not getting the public benefits (welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, child care, SSI, etc.) you deserve; <br>
                      - More generally, you cannot settle a disagreement and you are at risk of losing money or property; <br>
                      - If you have been charged with a crime, you should contact your local public defender office. <br>
                      <br>
                      It is much better to ask for legal advice first and find out that you do not need it, than to not ask and find out later that you needed a lawyer.

                      The Victim can file a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smartparenting.com.ph/health/wellness/barangay-protection-order-vawc-a1800-20191103-lfrm">BPO(Barangay Protection Order)</a>, It prohibits the abuser from physically harming, communicating, or lurking around the vicinity of the victim and her child/ren. The Barangay Protection Order or BPO is valid for fifteen (15) days. This can be renewed by repeating the application process at the barangay hall. Often, this is requested while the victim figures out her next move — to file a case or not.
